abstract = {Coupled biological and chemical systems, neural networks, social interacting species, the Internet and the World Wide Web, are only a few examples of systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical units. The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks’ dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering.}

    abstract = {Topological analysis and community detection in mobility complex networks have an essential role in many contexts, from economics to the environmental agenda. However, in many cases, the dynamic component of mobility data is not considered directly. In this paper, we study how topological indexes and community structure changes in a business day. For the analyzes, we use a mobility database with a high temporal resolution. Our case study is the city of São José dos Campos (Brazil)—the city is divided into 55 traffic zones. More than 20 thousand people were asked about their travels the day before the survey (Origin-Destination Survey). We generated a set of graphs, where each vertex represents a traffic zone, and the edges are weighted by the number of trips between them, restricted to a time window. We calculated topological properties, such as degree, clustering coefficient and diameter, and the network’s community structure. The results show spatially concise community structures related to geographical factors such as highways and the persistence of some communities for different timestamps. These analyses may support the definition and adjustment of public policies to improve urban mobility. For instance, the community structure of the network might be useful for defining inter-zone public transportation.},

  abstract = {"The scientific study of networks, including computer networks, social networks, and biological networks, has received an enormous amount of interest in the last few years. The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on a large scale, and the development of a variety of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract new knowledge from many different kinds of networks.  The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together for the first time the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas.    Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks"--},

 abstract = { For epidemiologists, evolutionary biologists, and health-care professionals, real-time and predictive modeling of infectious disease is of growing importance. This book provides a timely and comprehensive introduction to the modeling of infectious diseases in humans and animals, focusing on recent developments as well as more traditional approaches.  Matt Keeling and Pejman Rohani move from modeling with simple differential equations to more recent, complex models, where spatial structure, seasonal "forcing," or stochasticity influence the dynamics, and where computer simulation needs to be used to generate theory. In each of the eight chapters, they deal with a specific modeling approach or set of techniques designed to capture a particular biological factor. They illustrate the methodology used with examples from recent research literature on human and infectious disease modeling, showing how such techniques can be used in practice. Diseases considered include BSE, foot-and-mouth, HIV, measles, rubella, smallpox, and West Nile virus, among others. Particular attention is given throughout the book to the development of practical models, useful both as predictive tools and as a means to understand fundamental epidemiological processes. To emphasize this approach, the last chapter is dedicated to modeling and understanding the control of diseases through vaccination, quarantine, or culling.    Comprehensive, practical introduction to infectious disease modeling  Builds from simple to complex predictive models  Models and methodology fully supported by examples drawn from research literature  Practical models aid students' understanding of fundamental epidemiological processes  For many of the models presented, the authors provide accompanying programs written in Java, C, Fortran, and MATLAB  In-depth treatment of role of modeling in understanding disease control   },

author = {Petter Holme and Jari Saramäki},
abstract = {A great variety of systems in nature, society and technology–from the web of sexual contacts to the Internet, from the nervous system to power grids–can be modeled as graphs of vertices coupled by edges. The network structure, describing how the graph is wired, helps us understand, predict and optimize the behavior of dynamical systems. In many cases, however, the edges are not continuously active. As an example, in networks of communication via e-mail, text messages, or phone calls, edges represent sequences of instantaneous or practically instantaneous contacts. In some cases, edges are active for non-negligible periods of time: e.g., the proximity patterns of inpatients at hospitals can be represented by a graph where an edge between two individuals is on throughout the time they are at the same ward. Like network topology, the temporal structure of edge activations can affect dynamics of systems interacting through the network, from disease contagion on the network of patients to information diffusion over an e-mail network. In this review, we present the emergent field of temporal networks, and discuss methods for analyzing topological and temporal structure and models for elucidating their relation to the behavior of dynamical systems. In the light of traditional network theory, one can see this framework as moving the information of when things happen from the dynamical system on the network, to the network itself. Since fundamental properties, such as the transitivity of edges, do not necessarily hold in temporal networks, many of these methods need to be quite different from those for static networks. The study of temporal networks is very interdisciplinary in nature. Reflecting this, even the object of study has many names—temporal graphs, evolving graphs, time-varying graphs, time-aggregated graphs, time-stamped graphs, dynamic networks, dynamic graphs, dynamical graphs, and so on. This review covers different fields where temporal graphs are considered, but does not attempt to unify related terminology—rather, we want to make papers readable across disciplines.}

abstract = {Newly available datasets present exciting opportunities to investigate how human population movement contributes to the spread of infectious diseases across large geographical distances. It is now possible to construct realistic models of infectious disease dynamics for the purposes of understanding global-scale epidemics. Nevertheless, a remaining unanswered question is how best to leverage the new data to parameterize models of movement, and whether one’s choice of movement model impacts modeled disease outcomes. We adapt three well-studied models of infectious disease dynamics, the susceptible–infected–recovered model, the susceptible–infected–susceptible model, and the Ross–Macdonald model, to incorporate either of two candidate movement models. We describe the effect that the choice of movement model has on each disease model’s results, finding that in all cases, there are parameter regimes where choosing one movement model instead of another has a profound impact on epidemiological outcomes. We further demonstrate the importance of choosing an appropriate movement model using the applied case of malaria transmission and importation on Bioko Island, Equatorial Guinea, finding that one model produces intelligible predictions of R0, whereas the other produces nonsensical results.}}

abstract = {Ross-Macdonald models are the building blocks of most vector-borne disease models. Even for the same disease, different authors use different model formulations, but a study of the dynamical consequences of assuming different hypotheses is missing. In this work we present different formulations of the basic Ross-Macdonald model together with a careful discussion of the assumptions behind each model. The most general model presented is an agent based model for which arbitrary distributions for latency and infectious periods for both, host and vectors, is considered. At population level we also developed a deterministic Volterra integral equations model for which also arbitrary distributions in the waiting times are included. We compare the model solutions using different distributions for the infectious and latency periods using statistics, like the epidemic peak, or epidemic final size, to characterize the epidemic curves. The basic reproduction number (R0) for each formulation is computed and compared with empirical estimations obtained with the agent based models. The importance of considering realistic distributions for the latent and infectious periods is highlighted and discussed. We also show that seasonality is a key driver of vector-borne disease dynamics shaping the epidemic curve and its duration.}

Here, we use data from island-wide, annual malaria indicator surveys to investigate human movement patterns and their relationship to Plasmodium falciparum prevalence. Using geostatistical and mathematical modelling, we find that off-island travel is more prevalent in and around the capital, Malabo. The odds of malaria infection among off-island travelers are significantly higher than the rest of the population. We estimate that malaria importation rates are high enough to explain malaria prevalence in much of Malabo and its surroundings, and that local transmission is highest along the West Coast of the island. Despite uncertainty, these estimates of residual transmission and importation serve as a basis for evaluating progress towards elimination and for efficiently allocating resources as Bioko makes the transition from control to elimination.},

Here, we consider spatial heterogeneity, defined as ‘patchiness’ of the host population. After briefly reviewing how disease persistence is influenced by population size, reproduction number and infectious period, we explore its dependence on the level of spatial heterogeneity. Analysis and simulation of disease transmission in a symmetric meta-population suggest that disease persistence typically becomes worse as spatial heterogeneity increases, although local persistence optima can occur for infections with oscillatory population dynamics. We obtain insight into the dynamics that underlie the observed persistence patterns by studying the infection prevalence correlation between patches and by comparing full-model simulations to results obtained using simplified patch-level descriptions of the interplay between local extinctions and between-patch transmissions. The observed patterns are interpreted in terms of rescue effects for strong spatial heterogeneity and in terms of between-patch coherence and synchronization effects at intermediate and weak levels of heterogeneity.}

A review of relevant empirical literature identifies few metapopulations which fit this description well. Instead, three qualitatively different situations are found to be more common: (1) mainland-island and source-sink metapopulations, in which persistence depends on the existence of one or more extinction-resistant populations; (2) patchy populations, in which dispersal between patches or sub-populations is so high that the system is effectively a single extinction-resistant population; (3) non-equilibrium metapopulations, in which local extinction occurs in the course of a species' overall regional decline. This suggests a modified view of metapopulation dynamics in which local extinction is more an incidental than a central feature.}",

Starting in 1969, and accelerating since the early 1990s, mathematical models of metapopulations have shown the importance of landscape connectivity and dispersal for persistence of a species or of interacting species. Some metapopulation models have been fit to empirical data. Although pure metapopulations may be rare, there are many empirical studies in which metapopulation processes, primarily local colonization and extinction, have been useful in explaining dynamics of natural and experimental systems. Metapopulation ecology is used in conservation biology and in population genetics where it influences genetic structure, the rate and trajectory of evolution and even what traits are under selection. Finally, communities of species that are distributed in a landscape potentially form metacommunity, which is a concept that shares important characteristics with metapopulations. Key concepts: A metapopulation is made up of semiindependent local populations. In a metapopulation there is interplay between local and regional population dynamics. While few species may live as metapopulations in the strict sense, many species depend on metapopulation processes. That is, a species regional persistence depends on asynchronous local dynamics and dispersal. Predator–prey and competitive interactions may persist on a landscape scale due to metapopulation processes.}

However, most mechanistic models have difficulty estimating the time/region-varying epidemiological parameters, while most deep learning models lack the guidance of epidemiological domain knowledge and interpretability of prediction results. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid model called MepoGNN for multi-step multi-region epidemic forecasting by incorporating Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and graph learning mechanisms into Metapopulation SIR model. Our model can not only predict the number of confirmed cases but also explicitly learn the epidemiological parameters and the underlying epidemic propagation graph from heterogeneous data in an end-to-end manner. Experiment results demonstrate our model outperforms the existing mechanistic models and deep learning models by a large margin. Furthermore, the analysis on the learned parameters demonstrates the high reliability and interpretability of our model and helps better understanding of epidemic spread.

When will it arrive? Brockmann and Helbing (p. 1337; see the Perspective by McLean) analyzed disease spread via the “effective distance” rather than geographical distance, wherein two locations that are connected by a strong link are effectively close. The approach was successfully applied to predict disease arrival times or disease source using data from the the 2003 SARS viral epidemic, 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic, and the 2011 foodborne enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli outbreak in Germany. A model based on effective rather than geographical distance can reveal the origin, timing, and likely spread of epidemics. [Also see Perspective by McLean] The global spread of epidemics, rumors, opinions, and innovations are complex, network-driven dynamic processes. The combined multiscale nature and intrinsic heterogeneity of the underlying networks make it difficult to develop an intuitive understanding of these processes, to distinguish relevant from peripheral factors, to predict their time course, and to locate their origin. However, we show that complex spatiotemporal patterns can be reduced to surprisingly simple, homogeneous wave propagation patterns, if conventional geographic distance is replaced by a probabilistically motivated effective distance. In the context of global, air-traffic–mediated epidemics, we show that effective distance reliably predicts disease arrival times. Even if epidemiological parameters are unknown, the method can still deliver relative arrival times. The approach can also identify the spatial origin of spreading processes and successfully be applied to data of the worldwide 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and 2003 SARS epidemic.}}

The geometry of signal propagation is determined as much by the network topology as it is by the diverse forms of nonlinear interactions that may take place between the nodes. Advances are therefore often system dependent and have limited translational potential across domains. Given over two decades worth of research on the subject, the time is thus certainly ripe, indeed the need is urgent, for a comprehensive review of signal propagation in complex networks. We here first survey different models that determine the nature of interactions between the nodes, including epidemic models, Kuramoto models, diffusion models, cascading failure models, and models describing neuronal dynamics. Secondly, we cover different types of complex networks and their topologies, including temporal networks, multilayer networks, and neural networks. Next, we cover network time series analysis techniques that make use of signal propagation, including network correlation analysis, information transfer and nonlinear correlation tools, network reconstruction, source localization and link prediction, as well as approaches based on artificial intelligence. Lastly, we review applications in epidemiology, social dynamics, neuroscience, engineering, and robotics. Taken together, we thus provide the reader with an up-to-date review of the complexities associated with the network’s role in propagating signals in the hope of better harnessing this to devise innovative applications across engineering, the social and natural sciences as well as to inspire future research.}

abstract = {The COVID-19 outbreak is a global pandemic declared by the World Health Organization, with rapidly increasing cases in most countries. A wide range of research is urgently needed for understanding the COVID-19 pandemic, such as transmissibility, geographic spreading, risk factors for infections, and economic impacts. Reliable data archive and sharing are essential to jump-start innovative research to combat COVID-19. This research is a collaborative and innovative effort in building such an archive, including the collection of various data resources relevant to COVID-19 research, such as daily cases, social media, population mobility, health facilities, climate, socioeconomic data, research articles, policy and regulation, and global news. Due to the heterogeneity between data sources, our effort also includes processing and integrating different datasets based on GIS (Geographic Information System) base maps to make them relatable and comparable. To keep the data files permanent, we published all open data to the Harvard Dataverse (https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/2019ncov), an online data management and sharing platform with a permanent Digital Object Identifier number for each dataset. Finally, preliminary studies are conducted based on the shared COVID-19 datasets and revealed different spatial transmission patterns among mainland China, Italy, and the United States.}

A second strategy is commonly used, starting from the aggregation of the network states in several instants of time, within a temporal one - a simplification of the flows of people between locations. However, having the status of the network available at different times, reliable, with more partial results, numbers of confirmed cases, deaths, etc. accurate during a simulation. Some points that will be investigated in this project are: the quantification of the differences between a simulated dynamics in the temporal network and its static version; what is the difference in the distinction of the time scale of the network in relation to its more refined version, or to verify if it is possible to aggregate some states of the network and still obtain the same results and investigate the correspondences between the changes in the dynamics with the topological changes of the network, in time.},

abstract="The study is concerned with the fundamentals of granular computing and its application to neural networks. Granular computing, as the name itself stipulates, deals with representing information in the form of some aggregates (embracing a number of individual entitites) and their ensuing processing. We elaborate on the rationale behind granular computing. Next, a number of formal frameworks of information granulation are discussed including several alternatives such as fuzzy sets, interval analysis, rough sets, and probability. The notion of granularity itself is defined and quantified. A design agenda of granular computing is formulated and the key design problems are raised. A number of granular architectures are also discussed with an objective of dealinating the fundamental algorithmic and conceptual challenges. It is shown that the use of information granules of different size (granularity) lends itself to general pyramid architectures of information processing. The role of encoding and decoding mechanisms visible in this setting is also discussed in detail along with some particular solutions. Neural networks are primarily involved at the level of numeric optimization. Granularity of information introduces another dimension to the neurocomputing. We discuss the role of granular constructs in the design of neural networks and knowledge representation therein. The intent of this paper is to elaborate on the fundamentals and put the entire area in a certain perspective while not moving into specific algorithmic details.",
