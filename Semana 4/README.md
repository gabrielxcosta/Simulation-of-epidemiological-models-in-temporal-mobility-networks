## Zachary's Karate Club Network

Zachary's karate club is a social network of a university karate club, described in the paper "An Information Flow Model for Conflict and Fission in Small Groups" by Wayne W. Zachary. The network became a popular example of community structure in networks after its use by Michelle Girvan and Mark Newman in 2002.

## Zachary's Methodology

Before the split each side tried to recruit adherents of the other party. Thus, communication flow had a special importance and the initial group would likely split at the "borders" of the network. Zachary used the maximum flow ‚Äì minimum cut Ford‚ÄìFulkerson algorithm from ‚Äúsource‚Äù Mr. Hi to ‚Äúsink‚Äù John A: the cut closest to Mr. Hi that cuts saturated edges divides the network into the two factions. Zachary correctly predicted each member's decision except member #9, who went with Mr. Hi instead of John A.
